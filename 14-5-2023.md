Day 6 - 84, updated as per Excel sheet attached earlier, did some back tests on my photo and the counting was wrong, Note step 12 was skipped.

The rest is from previous commits, eventually did this on paper and got to 82.  
After trying to run this through code and overcomplicate everything by running down different paths due to the size of the data, I did this is the Excel workbook attached  
Steps followed, remove everything that occurred once  
Remove everything that seemed to far to join to the same value  with too many other characters in between then start removing manually because I now have a small amount of data  

Starting line after removing characters that are duplicated
